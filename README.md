# goal here is to develop an analysis package for an offshore vessel 
# the objective is to derive hydrostatic stability status based on the given input data and the 
# calculation of factors like KG,KB,GM,GZ and etc
# generating a GZ curve is desired
# The problem is to define what inputs we have to process in order to generate the required
# outputs.

general outline of the project ################################## 
# the first phase of the project is the clarification of all the required functionalities of
# this package.
# the second stage is the modeling of objects that are going to be processed in the analysis
# the third phase is coding the calculations and processing of data required to obtain the
# the results
# the last phase is validation of the results. 
# optional : its also recommended to create a GUI to insert the data after the main source code is developed
